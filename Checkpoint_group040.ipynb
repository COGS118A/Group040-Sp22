        "Our goal is to figure if it is possible to always win in a game of connect four. Since there are over 4 trillion different board states, we want to determine whether or not given any board state in a game without a guaranteed loss in the next move can result in a victory for the player red. Our data represents all possible board states where either player has not won yet. It is measured by having a variable for every single spot in a connect four board, and which piece is in that spot. Other variables include the two players, the board itself, the number of turns required to win, and the winrate if it is not guaranteed. We will be creating a neural network with these variables to maximize the possibility of winning in a connect four match in any scenario. Success will be determined when our neural nets only stop looking for the best net. "

The proportion between winning and losing in the end after a move and the number of turns it takes to reach the win will be related to making a good move. Ex: If putting red in the far right causes more losses in the end it will be considered a bad move (-1 point) ; if it takes more turns to win (a blunder) it will also be considered a bad move at a lower degree (-0.5 point) . \n",
