    "# Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to figure out if certain machine learning algorithms are able to beat the popular minimax search algorithm in a game of connect 4. We want the algortihms to determine whether or not given any board state in a game without a guaranteed loss in the next move, a \"checkmate\", can result in a victory for the player. Our data contains all possible board states where either player has not won yet, as well as whether or not that board state is a win for a particular player. It is measured by having a variable for every single spot in a connect four board, and which piece is in that spot. Other variables include the two players, the board, the number of turns required to win, and the winrate. We created a decision tree and a support vector machine model along with a minimax search algorithm.  We then created a simulation to have minimax and our models play against each other and recorded the winrate of both models and the minimax algorithm. Our results indicated that given our dataset and our methodologies to implementing models, classifiers cannot outperform minimax.\n",

    "# Background\n",
    " \n",
    "Connect 4 is a two player game where each player has a designated color putting a piece in a slot of a 6x7 sized board in an attempt to connect 4 of the same color. Although the game is simplistic, there are over 4 trillion combinations of a potential board state. This leaves the potential for machine learning models to optimize the game to win as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "We attempt to create a proper connect-4 bot that makes decisions solely based on decision tree and support vector machines. Given any board state, we want to have the models predict the outcomes and look for a winning scenario for all possible choices. This will be done by iterating through all possible moves and selecting the first time the models predict a win for that particular board state. Win or loss percentages will be determined based on the results. Each turn will be overlooked by the models. Total numbers of wins, draws, and losses will be counted for efficacy of each programs to be observed. Any Connect-4 board data may be used as data for this program."

    "\n",
    "Our minimax algorithm is a recursive search algorithm that will search all possible cominations of moves to a certain depth, and run a static evaluation of each state of the board. This alogrithm uses Alpha-Beta pruning in order to work more efficiently by ruling out the possibilities that a move will lead to a loss for the minimax. For this project, we had used a depth of 3 for efficiency, though a higher value will lead to a more accurate model\n",
    "\n",
    "To tune this algoirthm, we ran simulations of the model against the other models will adjusting the weights parameter. The weights determine how much to weigh each of the possible scenarios that influence that Connect-4 game. Each of the columns will start at a weight of 0 and, if a move in that column can lead to a four in a row, or if it can block a four in a row it will add a weight to that column. The weights we found to be most effective are `[10, 100, 10000]`. The `10` is used for moves that may lead to a two in a row, `100` for three in a row, and so on. We ran these simulations with different combinations of these numbers, with different rates of scaling, and ran it against the decision tree model 100 times and we would see how many wins it would be able to win.\n",

    "### Interpreting the result\n",
    "\n",
    "A potential major problem with the performance of both support vector machine and decision tree, is the low accuracy rate in finding the true win and loss state of the board. As a result, the models may not exercise a move that would increase the chances of winning. Another would be the lack information of classifiers. Unlike neural networks, the classifiers we used do not measure the degree to which a winning board state is winning or a losing board state is losing. Resultantly, the models must randomly choose a win state board. Yet another problem is due to the fact that these classifiers cannot make decisions past one turn into the future, unlike minimax where the depth of the search is virtually unlimited.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem with our work is that we were unable to create a bot to play against the minimax search algorithm using only the dataset and its information on the win/loss of each board state. Doing so would allow us to see the winrate of the dataset bot compared to the models, allowing us to identify where and how the results were formed. We only used standard supervised machine learning models to use to compare. Given more time we could have also used deep learning techniques such as neural networks or reinforced learning techniques such as monte carlo tree search to find more results to compare the strength of minimax. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "A potential ethical concern with our project topic is the unfair usage of bots as an advantage against other players. This would be a form of cheating, which is heavily condemned. Additionally, cheating in games harms other players by ruining their experience, which is also another ethical concern. Another concern with our project could be the lack of transparency of our model, making it unintelligble to humans how decisions are made by the model. Though this model is confined to the game of connect-4 and does not pose any real world harm, the extrapolation of the model in other systems may cause concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Bots created from classifiers are inferior to the minimax search algorithm because of their inability to convey more information to the bot, leading to a less intelligble decision. "
