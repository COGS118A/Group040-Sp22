    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",

    "Our goal is to figure if it is possible to always win in a game of connect four. Our data represents all possible board states where either player has not won yet. It is measured by having a variable for every single spot in a connect four board, and which piece is in that spot. We will be creating a neural network with these variables to maximize the possibility of winning in a connect four match in any scenario. Success will be determined when our neural nets only stop looking for the best net. "
